# Documentation Style

Write all documentation from the perspective of a developer writing for developers. Technical and factual.

**Do:**
- Use neutral, technical language
- State what exists, how it works, where it lives
- Use imperative or passive voice
- Reference files, APIs, and components directly

**Avoid:**
- Instructional tone ("you should", "we will implement")
- AI-writing-for-user style
- Explaining how to work; document what is and how it behaves
