# Documentation Style

**Technical documentation** (ARCHITECTURE, DATA-FLOW, SYNC-LOGIC, IDEAS-*, I18N internals): Developer perspective. Factual, neutral. State what exists, how it works, where it lives. Avoid instructional tone.

**User/contributor-facing docs** (TRANSLATING, CONTRIBUTING, README contributor section): Welcoming, explanatory. Step-by-step where helpful. "You can help", "Step by step" — appropriate for translators and contributors.
