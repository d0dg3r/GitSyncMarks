# Locale Translation Workflow

When editing locale files in `_locales/*/messages.json`:

- Add new UI text keys in `_locales/en/messages.json` first.
- Other locale files may temporarily miss new keys; runtime must fall back to English.
- Translation completion for non-English locales can be done in a separate follow-up task.
- Keep key names identical across all locale files.
- Preserve valid JSON formatting and existing structure.
- Before release, schedule or complete locale update work for newly introduced keys.
