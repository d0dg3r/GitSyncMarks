# English-Only Default

Use English as the default language for all work in this repository.

- Write code comments, docs, changelog text, and user-facing copy in English.
- Use English for commit messages, PR titles, and PR descriptions.
- Keep identifiers (variables, functions, classes, files) in English.
- If a task starts in another language, still produce implementation artifacts in English unless explicitly requested otherwise.
- Existing translated locale files may be edited, but new source/default text should be authored in English first.
