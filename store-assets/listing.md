### Name
BookHub

### Summary (max 132 characters)
Sync your browser bookmarks bidirectionally with a GitHub repository. Auto-sync, conflict detection, and Markdown export included.

### Detailed Description
BookHub syncs your browser bookmarks with a GitHub repository — bidirectionally, automatically, and without any external server.

Features:
• Bidirectional sync between your browser and GitHub
• Auto-sync on every bookmark change (with 5-second debounce)
• Periodic pull every 15 minutes to detect remote changes (configurable)
• Manual Push, Pull, and full Sync via the popup
• Conflict detection when both local and remote bookmarks were modified
• Dual format: bookmarks stored as JSON (for sync) and Markdown (human-readable on GitHub)
• No external server — communicates directly with the GitHub API using your Personal Access Token

How it works:
1. Create a GitHub repository for your bookmarks
2. Generate a Personal Access Token with the "repo" scope
3. Configure BookHub with your token and repository
4. Click "Sync Now" — done!

Your bookmarks are stored as bookmarks.json and bookmarks.md in your repository. The Markdown file gives you a clean, readable overview of all your bookmarks directly on GitHub.

BookHub is fully open source: https://github.com/d0dg3r/BookHub

### Permission Justifications

| Permission | Justification |
|------------|---------------|
| `bookmarks` | Required to read and write the user's bookmarks for synchronization with GitHub. |
| `storage` | Required to store extension settings (token, repo config) and sync state (timestamps, SHAs) locally in the browser. |
| `alarms` | Required to schedule periodic background sync checks for remote changes. |
| `host_permissions: https://api.github.com/*` | Required to communicate with the GitHub REST API to read and write bookmark files in the user's repository. |

### Data Use Disclosure

**Does your extension collect or transmit user data?**
Yes — the extension reads the user's bookmarks and transmits them to the GitHub API (api.github.com) to store them in the user's own repository.

**What data is collected?**
- Browser bookmarks (titles, URLs, folder structure)

**Is data transmitted to any server?**
- Only to api.github.com, authenticated with the user's own Personal Access Token
- No other servers, no analytics, no tracking

**Is data sold or transferred to third parties?**
No.

### Additional Instructions

This extension requires a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to function. No shared test account is needed — the reviewer can create their own in under 2 minutes:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=BookHub+Test
2. Click "Generate token" and copy it
3. Create a new empty repository on GitHub (e.g. "bookmark-test")
4. Click the BookHub extension icon, then "Settings"
5. Enter the token, your GitHub username as "Repository Owner", and the repo name
6. Click "Test Connection" — it should show "Connection OK!"
7. Click "Save Settings"
8. Return to the popup and click "Sync Now"
9. Verify bookmarks appear in the GitHub repository as bookmarks.json and bookmarks.md

No login credentials are required. The extension only communicates with api.github.com using the reviewer's own token.
