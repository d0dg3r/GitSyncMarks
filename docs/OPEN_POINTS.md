## Open Points

### Backup (Import/Export)

The Backup tab behavior changes with multiple profiles. Needs review and possibly adjustment:

- **Settings export/import:** Already includes profiles with decrypted tokens (see [options.js](../options.js) lines 516–636). Verify migration from legacy format and round-trip export/import.
- **Bookmark export/import:** Exports all browser bookmarks; import replaces local bookmarks. Clarify whether per-profile export (e.g. "export current profile only") is needed, and how import interacts with multiple profiles.
- **UI:** Consider indicating which profile's data is affected when importing bookmarks.

### Other (optional)

- **Profile limit:** Currently 10 profiles. Consider displaying in options.
