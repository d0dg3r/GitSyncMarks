## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Spinner**: Loading indicators during profile switch and Test Connection
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Quick sync (Ctrl+Shift+.), open options (Ctrl+Shift+,); customizable in browser extension settings
- **Help tab**: New tab in options with keyboard shortcuts and main features overview (popup, profiles, auto-sync, conflicts)
- **French and Spanish**: New languages (Français, Español) in the language selector

### Changed

- **Profile switch**: Inline confirmation instead of `confirm()`; optional toggle "Switch without confirmation"
- **Profile layout**: Redesigned Profile card (label, dropdown, actions, toggle, inline confirmation)

- **Testing guide** ([docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)): Instructions for Chrome, Firefox desktop, and Firefox Android

## [2.1.1] - TBD

### Changed

- **New icon**: Updated logo (blue bookmark + green sync arrow on black background) across extension, store assets, and favicons

## [2.1.0] - 2025-02-10

### Added

- **Sync profiles**: Presets for real-time (1 min), frequent (5 min), normal (15 min), and power-save (60 min) sync — each with tuned debounce delay
- **Custom sync profile**: Manual interval and debounce settings
- **Sync on browser start**: Optional automatic sync when the browser starts
- **Sync when browser gains focus**: Optional sync when switching back to the browser (with 60s cooldown)
- **Commit link in popup**: Last commit hash shown as a clickable link to GitHub
- **Next sync countdown**: Countdown timer until the next periodic sync (when auto-sync is on)
- **Theme selector**: Light, dark, or auto (system) — applies to options page and popup
- **Pre-release workflow**: Tags like `v2.1.0-pre.1`, `v2.1.0-alpha.1`, `v2.1.0-beta.1`, `v2.1.0-rc.1` create GitHub Pre-releases
- **Language selector** in options header (moved from Settings tab)

### Changed

- **Project renamed**: BookHub → GitSyncMarks
- **Firefox**: New extension ID `gitsyncmarks@d0dg3r` — existing Firefox users must uninstall the old extension and install the new one
- **IndexedDB migration**: Automatic migration from `bookhub-keys` to `gitsyncmarks-keys` — existing users keep their token without re-entering it
- **Options tabs**: Reorganized into GitHub, Synchronization, Backup, Automation, About
- **Backup tab**: Redesigned with clearer block layout, descriptions per action, file picker with chosen filename display
- **Last data change**: Popup shows "Last data change" instead of "Last sync" when changes were pushed
- **Debounce**: Configurable per profile; max-wait cap prevents indefinite deferral (30s or 6× debounce)
- **package.json**: Version kept in sync with manifest for releases
