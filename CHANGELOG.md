## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - TBD

### Added

- **Sync profiles**: Presets for real-time (1 min), frequent (5 min), normal (15 min), and power-save (60 min) sync — each with tuned debounce delay
- **Custom sync profile**: Manual interval and debounce settings
- **Sync on browser start**: Optional automatic sync when the browser starts
- **Sync when browser gains focus**: Optional sync when switching back to the browser (with 60s cooldown)
- **Commit link in popup**: Last commit hash shown as a clickable link to GitHub
- **Next sync countdown**: Countdown timer until the next periodic sync (when auto-sync is on)
- **Pre-release workflow**: Tags like `v2.1.0-pre.1`, `v2.1.0-alpha.1`, `v2.1.0-beta.1`, `v2.1.0-rc.1` create GitHub Pre-releases
- **Language selector** in options header (moved from Settings tab)

### Changed

- **Options tabs**: Reorganized into GitHub, Synchronization, Backup, Automation, About
- **Last data change**: Popup shows "Last data change" instead of "Last sync" when changes were pushed
